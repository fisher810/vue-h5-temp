We want you to have fun, safe, and engaging connections, so please avoid violations to prevent score reduction. ',
    'p2title': 'How is my score calculated?',
    'p2des': `<p style="margin-bottom: 7px">Please be aware that during our beta period, your score may change due to adjustment of scoring strategy but this will not impact your position and rank amongst other users. We are always looking to improve the quality of connections in our community, and we welcome any questions or feedback from you. </p>
    1. Each user begins with a standard initial score that increases or decreases according to the user's behavior<br>
    2. Scores range between 0 and 100, a high score indicates high credibility and healthy behavior patterns within the LivU community and a low score can result in restricted functionality or community removal<br>

    (1) Personal information<br>
    You will receive points according to how complete your personal information is and your account binding completion status<br>
    (2) Daily activity<br>
    You will receive points according to daily activity such as how frequently you interact with our community<br>
    (3) Meaningful connection<br>
    You will receive points based on your video call duration, new Thumbs-up on your profile, new friends in your cycle, chat interactions and other social interactions<br>
    (4) Gold coins<br>
    You will receive points each time you use Gold Coins including minute billing calls, gifts, and premium matching<br>
    (5) Violation<br>
    You will lose points if you violate any of our guidelines in a video call, over chat, or on your personal profile<br>
    4. Changes to your score resulting from completing missions and guideline violations are shown in real-time, whereas changes to your score resulting from user activity and gold coins are calculated and updated once per day`,
